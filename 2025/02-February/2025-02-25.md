# 🗓️ Work Log — 2025-02-25

## ✅ Summary
Resolved high-severity code quality issues flagged by static analysis on a microfrontend used in a government service portal. Issues included code smells, vulnerabilities, and minor bugs. Jira ticket documented as part of [BUGS25-25].

## 🧠 Problem
Static analysis tools flagged the following issues:

- 🟥 387 Major  
- 🟧 2 Critical  
- ⬛ 1 Vulnerability  
- 🟨 Code Smells (redundant, unused blocks)  
- 🐛 Bugs (non-promise await, insecure config usage)

Most issues appeared in legacy JavaScript code related to:

- Entity validation logic  
- Module Pengawasan (monitoring module)  
- Data TPB (export-import documentation)

## 🔍 Investigation

Key findings:

- Unused variables and commented-out code bloated the codebase  
- Insecure padding and encryption schemes were flagged  
- Redundant assignments and empty blocks in many files  
- Improper use of await on non-promise expressions

## 💡 Solution

Example code adjustments:

```js
// Removed commented block
// const unused = "legacy";

// Fixed insecure encryption
const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv("aes-256-cbc", key, iv); // secure config used

// Avoided redundant assignment
let a = b; // removed if b is unused

// Cleaned up empty blocks
if (x) { } // → removed block
```

Issue count reduced:

| Severity   | Before | After | Fixed |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|
| BLOCKER    | 0      | 0     | 0      |
| CRITICAL   | 2      | 0     | 2      |
| MAJOR      | 387    | 0     | 387    |

✅ Validated through multiple levels:

- SC test environment passed on 17 Feb 2025  
- Vulnerability testing passed on 24 Feb 2025  
- QC review: LULUS (passed)

## 🧪 Result

- ✅ Clean scan for CRITICAL and MAJOR categories  
- ✅ Code promoted from bugfix branch to staging  
- ✅ Ready for merge and deployment  

## 📁 Files Affected

- Validator modules  
- Monitoring (Pengawasan) modules  
- Utilities and encryption configs  

## 🔧 Stack

JavaScript, GitLab CI/CD, Custom Static Scanner (SonarQube), Microfrontend Architecture

## 🧠 Reflection

Code quality cleanup isn’t just about reducing red flags — it creates clearer logic and better maintainability. This session highlights the importance of setting secure defaults and avoiding legacy pitfalls in enterprise codebases.
