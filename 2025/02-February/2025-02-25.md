# 🗓️ Work Log — 2025-02-25

## ✅ Summary
Cleaned up major SonarQube issues on the inhouse-kln microfrontend project by removing or resolving BLOCKER, CRITICAL, and MAJOR issues.

## 🧠 Problem
SonarQube scan showed:
- 387 Major
- 2 Critical
- 0 Blocker

Most issues were related to:
- Code smells
- Bug types (7)
- Vulnerabilities (1)

These were visible on the following SonarQube view:
http://10.102.244.26:9000/project/issues?id=inhouse-kln_CP-2832&resolved=false&severities=BLOCKER%2CCRITICAL%2CMAJOR

## 🔍 Investigation
Issues came mostly from legacy modules within microfrontend's validator and controller logic. They included:
- Unused variable declarations
- Redundant conditions
- Missing null checks
- Improper error handling

## 💡 Solution
Examples of cleanup:
```js
// Removed unreachable return
return true;
return false;

// Replaced == with ===
if (status == 'done') → if (status === 'done')

// Added null/undefined guard
if (data && data.value) { ... }
```

## 🧪 Result
- ✅ Project passed QC review and all tests after cleanup
- ✅ Branch merged to bugfix_va
- ✅ Issue count dropped to zero for all high-severity levels

## 📁 Files Affected
- Multiple files across the validator, utils, and controller layers

## 🔧 Stack
JavaScript, SonarQube, GitLab CI, Microfrontend Architecture

## 🧠 Reflection
This cleanup shows the importance of early static analysis integration. Many legacy issues can be automatically flagged and prevented if we integrate SonarQube with strict gates into the pipeline.
