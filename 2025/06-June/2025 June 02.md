# 🗓️ Work Log — 26 MAY - 11 JUNE-2025

## ✅ Summary

  - Removed the default date range filter when opening the "Edit Penutupan Pos" menu in the Inhouse Manifest, allowing for full manual date selection.

## 🧠 Problem

When users accessed the "Edit Penutupan Pos" menu within the Inhouse Manifest, the date range filter (`filterDateEditPenutupanPos`) was automatically populated with a default range (12 months from the current date). This prevented users from having a clear, empty input for manual date selection, leading to an inconvenient user experience.

## 🔍 Investigation

  - The issue was identified as a bug by the IKC Team and is tracked under Jira ticket [\#BUGS25-420].
  - The problem was categorized as a Frontend (FE) issue affecting the "Modul Manifes".
  - The task was created on May 26, 2025, and its status was updated to "Done" on June 11, 2025.
  - The specific code responsible for setting the default date was found in the `useEffect` hook within `browseEditPenutupanPos.js`, which dispatched actions to `filterDateEditPenutupanPos` with pre-calculated `startDate` and `endDate`.

## 💡 Solution

The default `startDate` and `endDate` parameters passed to `dispatch(filterDateEditPenutupanPos(...))` were removed from the `useEffect` hook. Instead of `moment(date).format(...)` values, they are now set to empty strings (`''`), which effectively clears any default date range.

```js
// src/pages/manifest/edit-penutupan-pos/browseEditPenutupanPos.js
// ...
  useEffect(() => {
      const date = new Date();
      dispatch(filterDateEditPenutupanPos({
        kodeKantor: dataUser.kodeKantor,
-        endDate : moment(date).format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
-        startDate: moment(date).subtract(12, 'month').format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
+        endDate : '',
+        startDate: '',
      }))
  },[])
// ...
```

## 🧪 Result

  - ✅ Verified fix: When the "Edit Penutupan Pos" menu is opened, the date range filter is now empty by default, allowing users to freely select their desired date range.
  - ✅ Tested edge cases: Source code vulnerability tests passed, as indicated by "Status Uji SC: Tested Lulus".
