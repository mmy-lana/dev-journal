# 🗓️ Work Log — 30 June 2025

## ✅ Summary
Refactored the field name for "jenisRedress" from `tdJenisRedress` to `jenisRedress` in NVOCC creation and document generation forms.

## 🧠 Problem
Inconsistent naming conventions for the `jenisRedress` field were causing potential confusion and maintainability issues across the NVOCC module. The field was previously named `tdJenisRedress` in some parts of the codebase.

## 🔍 Investigation
I identified that the `tdJenisRedress` field name was being used when saving header NVOCC redress data and when creating NVOCC documents, while the intended and more consistent name should be `jenisRedress`. This was a simple naming inconsistency rather than a functional bug.

## 💡 Solution
Updated the field name from `tdJenisRedress` to `jenisRedress` in the relevant function calls.

```js
// In CreateNewNVOCC.js
saveHeaderNvoccRedress({
  ...sendDataHeader,
  idNvoccHeader: dataNVOCCEdit.idNvoccHeader,
  jenisRedress: jenisPermohonanRedressTerpilih, // Changed from tdJenisRedress
  ttNVOCCMasters: dataNVOCCEdit.ttNVOCCMasters,
})

// In DocumentCreator.js
tanggalDaftar: null,
tanggalTiba: newTanggalJamTiba,
ttNVOCCMasters: getMasterNvoccById,
jenisRedress: jenisPermohonanRedressTerpilih // Changed from tdJenisRedress
````

## 🧪 Result

  - ✅ Verified fix: The `jenisRedress` field is now consistently named and used when saving NVOCC header redress information and when generating NVOCC documents.
  - ✅ Tested edge cases: Ensured that the change did not impact the functionality of saving or generating documents with various types of redress selections.
