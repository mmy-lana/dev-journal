# 🗓️ Work Log — 08 - 15 JULY 2025

## Pushed on Gitlab/Repositories 10/Jul/25 15:10

## ✅ Summary

- Implemented a feature to resend tax invoice with selectable options between **PIB** and **SPTNP** for documents with code 20.
- Added modal confirmation and radio button logic to differentiate between PIB and SPTNP flows.
- Replaced hardcoded API calls with `.env` environment variable references.
- Adjusted response message handler to show proper errors for keywords like "tidak" or "gagal".

---

## 🧠 Problem

The tax invoice resend feature for dokumen 2.0 required enhancement to support SPTNP flows based on API response context. Additionally, several API URLs were hardcoded, and the success/error logic did not cover certain real-world edge cases.

---

## 🔍 Investigation

- Jira Ticket: [#BUGS25-620](https://jira.beacukai.go.id/browse/BUGS25-620)
- Module: Modul Dokumen Pabean, CEISA Pelayanan (Frontend)
- Menu: Dokumen Pabean > filter dokumen 2.0 > Aksi > Kirim Ulang Faktur Pajak
- Default submission uses PIB, but SPTNP appears as a radio button only when `uraianSingkatRespon === 'SPTNP'`.
- Used the following endpoints:
  - `GET /v2/parser/v1/Respon/getRespon/{idHeader}/{noAju}`
  - `POST /insert-faktur-pajak-pib/{noAju}`
  - `POST /insert-pajak-sptnp/{noAju}`

---

## 💡 Solution

- Added a new button **"Kirim Ulang Faktur Pajak"** with modal confirmation and dynamic radio options.
- Introduced detection logic to determine if SPTNP response exists.
- Rewrote the API handler to dynamically generate the correct endpoint based on the selected document type.
- Used `process.env.REACT_APP_API_*` constants for all API URLs.
- Updated response message handler using:
  ```js
  const containsTidakAtauGagal = /(tidak|gagal)/i.test(msg);
  ```

---

## 🧪 Result

- ✅ Feature works as expected in all tested environments.
- ✅ Successfully handles both PIB and SPTNP submission.
- ✅ Environment-specific URLs now load correctly.
- ✅ Error messages accurately reflect API failures.
- ✅ Status Uji SC: `TestedAdaTiketBaru`

## 🧠 Reflection

This task improved not only the feature logic for "Kirim Ulang Faktur Pajak" but also reinforced a best practice of removing hardcoded API endpoints. Ensuring error messages are informative and accurate builds user trust and helps with debugging.
