# 🗓️ Work Log — 22,23,25,28 APRIL-2025

## ✅ Summary
- Adjusted the "Kode Gudang" filter on the Browse PKB menu to correctly fetch and display data, including adding an async fetch for `kode gudang` options.
- Added a new column "Nama Gudang" to the Browse PKB page table, which displays a combination of `Kode Gudang` and `Nama Gudang`.
- Fixed a missing slash (`/`) in an API endpoint call.

## 🧠 Problem
The filter for `kode gudang` on the Browse PKB menu needed adjustments for proper functionality and display. Specifically, there was a missing slash in an API endpoint, the `kode gudang` selection input needed an async fetch mechanism, and the table on the Browse PKB page required a new column to display the combined `Kode Gudang - Nama Gudang` for better clarity.

## 🔍 Investigation
- The issue was tracked under Jira ticket [#BUGS25-248].
- The problem affected the "Frontend" and specifically the "Modul Monitoring" within "CEISA Pelayanan".
- The API endpoint involved in the missing slash fix was `v1/browse/get-gudang-tps`.
- The task was created on April 21, 2025, and updated on April 28, 2025, with a "Done" status.

## 💡 Solution
- **API Endpoint Fix**: Corrected the URL for the `get-gudang-tps` API call by adding a missing slash.
- **Kode Gudang Select Input**:
    - Introduced `kodeGudang` and `kodeGudangOptions` states.
    - Implemented `fetchKodeGudang` asynchronous function to retrieve `kode gudang` data from the API and populate the `kodeGudangOptions` state.
    - Added a `Select` component for `Kode Gudang` with `showSearch` and `allowClear` properties, binding its value to the `kodeGudang` state.
- **Nama Gudang Column**:
    - Added a new column titled "Nama Gudang" to the table.
    - The `render` function for this column now displays a combined string of `kodeGudang` and `namaGudang` (e.g., `${e?.kodeGudang || ''} - ${e?.namaGudang || ''}`).

## 🧪 Result
- ✅ Verified fix: The filter for `kode gudang` now functions as expected, with the correct API calls and data population.
- ✅ Verified fix: The "Nama Gudang" column correctly displays the combined `Kode Gudang` and `Nama Gudang` values on the Browse PKB page.
- ✅ Tested edge cases: Source code vulnerability test passed.

## 🧠 Reflection
The implementation of asynchronous fetching for the `kode gudang` filter and the addition of the "Nama Gudang" column significantly enhanced the usability and data presentation within the Browse PKB module. The API endpoint fix also ensures data integrity and proper communication with the backend.
