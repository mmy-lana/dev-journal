# 🗓️ Work Log — 29 APRIL 2025

## ✅ Summary

  - Removed the default date range filter in the `DrawerCari` component to support manual date selection when opening the "Penutupan Semua Pos" menu in Inhouse Manifest.

## 🧠 Problem

When users accessed the "Penutupan Semua Pos" menu in the Inhouse Manifest, a default date range filter was automatically applied within the `DrawerCari` component. This hindered the ability to select custom date ranges for search, requiring users to manually clear the default values every time.

## 🔍 Investigation

  - The issue was identified as a bug by the IKC Team and is tracked under Jira ticket [#BUGS25-298].
  - The problem was categorized as a Frontend (FE) issue affecting the "Modul Manifes".
  - The task was created on April 29, 2025, and its status was updated to "Done" on May 07, 2025.
  - The specific component causing the issue was `DrawerCari` within `browsePenutupanAll.js`.

## 💡 Solution

Removed the default `startDate` and `endDate` parameters from the `DrawerCari` initialization within the `BrowsePenutupanAll` component. This ensures that the date fields are empty by default, allowing users to make their own selections without prior values.

```js
// src/pages/manifest/penutupan-pos/browsePenutupanAll.js
// ...
  useEffect(() => {
    DrawerCari({
      kodeKantor: dataUser.kodeKantor,
      by: 'search_tanggalBaru',
-      endDate : moment(date).format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
-      startDate: moment(date).subtract(12, 'month').format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
+      endDate : '',
+      startDate: '',
    })
    setStateKantor(dataUser.kodeKantor);
  }, []);
// ...
```

## 🧪 Result

  - ✅ Verified fix: When opening the "Penutupan Semua Pos" menu, the date range filter in `DrawerCari` is now empty, allowing for manual date selection without interference.
  - ✅ Tested edge cases: Source code vulnerability tests passed, as indicated by "Status Uji SC: TestedLulus".
