# 🗓️ Work Log — from 2025-03-12 to 2025-03-13 

## ✅ Summary
Conducted another round of high-severity cleanup for issues flagged by static analysis on the microfrontend project. The goal was to reduce all BLOCKER, CRITICAL, and MAJOR severity issues to zero.

## 🧠 Problem
SonarQube reported the following before cleanup:

- 🐞 Bugs: 54  
- 🛡️ Vulnerabilities: 1  
- 🧹 Code Smells: 1,900+  

By severity:

- 🟥 Blocker: 4  
- 🟧 Critical: 6  
- 🟨 Major: 894  

## 🔍 Investigation

The flagged issues were found across legacy modules. Examples included:

- Insecure crypto configuration and logic branches with unreachable code  
- Redundant or commented-out code blocks  
- Null checks that were either missing or ineffective  
- Excessive nesting or repeated conditionals  
- Deprecated logic in helper methods for business rules

## 💡 Solution

Examples of changes:
```js
// Avoided unsafe await
// Before
await nonPromiseFunc();

// After
nonPromiseFunc();

// Removed useless assignment
let temp = obj.value;
temp = null;

// Cleaned up secure config
crypto.createCipheriv("aes-256-cbc", key, iv); // replaced deprecated mode
```

## 📊 Issue Fix Summary

| Severity   | Before | After | Fixed |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|
| BLOCKER    | 4      | 0     | 4      |
| CRITICAL   | 6      | 0     | 6      |
| MAJOR      | 894    | 0     | 894    |

## 🧪 Result

- ✅ All high-priority static issues cleared  
- ✅ Pushed and verified on CI/CD pipelines  
- ✅ Re-tested affected menus in staging

## 📁 Files Affected

- Multiple files across business logic, helper modules, and entity schemas

## 🔧 Stack

JavaScript (ES6+), Microfrontend (React-based), Static Analysis (SonarQube), GitLab CI/CD

## 🧠 Reflection

While the bulk of issues were categorized as smells, a number of potential security and logic risks were eliminated. Maintaining this level of hygiene long-term requires stricter rulesets, gated merges, and unit test coverage.

📎 Attachment: Jira evidence retained internally.
