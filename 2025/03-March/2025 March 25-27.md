# 🗓️ Work Log — 25–27 March 2025

## ✅ Summary
Resolved weak cryptography issues and cleaned up major SonarQube vulnerabilities in the Rush Handling microfrontend app. Focused primarily on replacing weak hashing usage and reducing all high-severity issues to zero.

## 🧠 Problem
SonarQube security scan highlighted the following issues:

- 🔐 Weak cryptographic implementation (SHA-256 digest in AES key derivation)
- 🧪 2 Security Hotspots (medium) marked for review
- 🧹 17 Major issues, 1 Critical, 1 Vulnerability
- 🐛 2 Bugs, 15 Code Smells

Specifically, Sonar flagged the usage of crypto.createHash('sha256') for deriving AES-256-CBC keys as weak when not paired with secure padding and context isolation.

## 🔍 Investigation
The vulnerable code appeared in Chiper.js encryption and decryption utilities:

```js
// Before (unsafe digest key derivation)
let cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(crypto.createHash('sha256').update(...).digest(...)), iv);
```

Also found:
- Useless variable assignments
- Deprecated buffer handling and logic confusion across modules

## 💡 Solution

- Refactored key derivation to use environment-bound secrets only (removing digest)
- Removed redundant assignments and console logs flagged as major issues
- Cleaned up logic blocks that were triggering critical security hotspots

Example fix:
```diff
- let cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(crypto.createHash(...)), iv);
+ let cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(REACT_APP_KC_SECRETKEY), iv);
```

## 📊 Issue Fix Summary

| Type          | Before | After | Fixed |
|---------------|--------|-------|--------|
| Bug           | 2      | 0     | 2      |
| Vulnerability | 1      | 0     | 1      |
| Code Smell    | 15     | 0     | 15     |

| Severity   | Before | After | Fixed |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|
| Critical   | 1      | 0     | 1      |
| Major      | 17     | 0     | 17     |
| Blocker    | 0      | 0     | 0      |

Security Hotspots:
- Medium: 2 → 0 (resolved)

## 🧪 Result

- ✅ Security scan cleared all high-risk issues
- ✅ Staging branch passed QC with no blockers
- ✅ Jira task [BUGS25-163] marked Done

## 📁 Files Affected

- src/utils/Chiper.js
- Modules across rush-handling-portal-app

## 🔧 Stack

JavaScript (Node.js), SonarQube, GitLab CI, AES-256-CBC, Environment Secrets

## 🧠 Reflection

Relying on hash digests for key derivation can appear correct but lacks the necessary security guarantees. Moving forward, sensitive logic must follow well-reviewed patterns. Recommend static review hooks and deeper integration testing before merging security-related modules.
