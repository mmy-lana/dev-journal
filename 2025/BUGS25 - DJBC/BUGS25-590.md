# üóìÔ∏è Work Log ‚Äî 02 - 17 JULY 2025

## Pushed on Gitlab/Repositories 11/Jul/25 15:07

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Added secure **API integration for `simpan_log_permohonan`** on the **3D Permit Submission Form**.
- Ensured correct payload structure, `Bearer` token authentication, and updated UI flow.
- Refactored request submission logic to await logging before redirect.

---

## üß† Problem

During submission of Permohonan 3D, **some form data failed to persist** due to missing or improperly sequenced log saving. The system lacked a proper integration for the `simpan_log_permohonan` API, risking data loss for export permissions.

---

## üîç Investigation

- Issue ID: [#BUGS25-590](https://jira.beacukai.go.id/browse/BUGS25-590)
- Identified through internal user reports and QA validation.
- Occurred in the `Form3D` component inside `TIGA D PORTAL`.
- Log API (`/servicetigad/izin/simpan_log_permohonan`) was not being called or failed silently.

---

## üí° Solution

- Created `sendApplicationLog()` method for POSTing log data.
- Constructed a full payload from form values and decoded user token using `jwt-decode`.
- Used `axios.post()` with `Bearer` authentication from local token.
- Set application log status flags to track and reflect success/failure.
- Updated form submission handler to **await** `sendApplicationLog` before navigation.

---

## üß™ Result

- ‚úÖ Payload successfully persisted in backend logs before redirect.
- ‚úÖ Status `applicationLogStatus` toggled between `loading`, `success`, or `error`.
- ‚úÖ Prevented premature navigation if log saving failed.
- ‚úÖ Log entries now complete with `seqIzin`, company info, NIB, NPWP15, and export flow details.

---

## üìÅ Files Affected

- `src/pages/Form3D/PerekamanForm3D/index.js`

---

## üìå Code Changes & Explanation

### ‚úÖ New Method: `sendApplicationLog()`
```js
const sendApplicationLog = async () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  const decoded = jwt_decode(token);
  const payload = {
    ...form.getFieldsValue(),
    npwp15: decoded?.npwp15,
    nib: decoded?.nib,
    nama_perusahaan: decoded?.nama_perusahaan,
  };

  setApplicationLogStatus("loading");
  try {
    await axios.post("/servicetigad/izin/simpan_log_permohonan", payload, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    });
    setApplicationLogStatus("success");
  } catch (e) {
    setApplicationLogStatus("error");
    message.error("Gagal menyimpan log permohonan");
  }
};
```

### üîÑ Adjusted Form Submission
- Modified the submit handler to await `sendApplicationLog()` before continuing to backend submission or redirect.
- Prevented navigation to the next page if logging failed.

### üîç Why It Matters
- Guarantees logging as part of the core submission workflow.
- Ensures compliance with audit trail requirements.
- Prevents accidental skips due to async issues or silent failures in logging.

React, Ant Design, Axios, JWT, TIGA D PORTAL

## üß† Reflection

This fix reinforces the importance of **reliable logging** in permit and export workflows. By placing the logging API at the right execution point and ensuring success before navigation, we prevent silent failures and ensure traceability for each permit submission.
