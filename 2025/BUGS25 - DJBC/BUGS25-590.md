# 🗓️ Work Log — 02 - 17 JULY 2025

## Pushed on Gitlab/Repositories 11/Jul/25 15:07

## ✅ Summary

- Added secure **API integration for `simpan_log_permohonan`** on the **3D Permit Submission Form**.
- Ensured correct payload structure, `Bearer` token authentication, and updated UI flow.
- Refactored request submission logic to await logging before redirect.

---

## 🧠 Problem

During submission of Permohonan 3D, **some form data failed to persist** due to missing or improperly sequenced log saving. The system lacked a proper integration for the `simpan_log_permohonan` API, risking data loss for export permissions.

---

## 🔍 Investigation

- Issue ID: [#BUGS25-590](https://jira.beacukai.go.id/browse/BUGS25-590)
- Identified through internal user reports and QA validation.
- Occurred in the `Form3D` component inside `TIGA D PORTAL`.
- Log API (`/servicetigad/izin/simpan_log_permohonan`) was not being called or failed silently.

---

## 💡 Solution

- Created `sendApplicationLog()` method for POSTing log data.
- Constructed a full payload from form values and decoded user token using `jwt-decode`.
- Used `axios.post()` with `Bearer` authentication from local token.
- Set application log status flags to track and reflect success/failure.
- Updated form submission handler to **await** `sendApplicationLog` before navigation.

---

## 🧪 Result

- ✅ Payload successfully persisted in backend logs before redirect.
- ✅ Status `applicationLogStatus` toggled between `loading`, `success`, or `error`.
- ✅ Prevented premature navigation if log saving failed.
- ✅ Log entries now complete with `seqIzin`, company info, NIB, NPWP15, and export flow details.

## 🧠 Reflection

This fix reinforces the importance of **reliable logging** in permit and export workflows. By placing the logging API at the right execution point and ensuring success before navigation, we prevent silent failures and ensure traceability for each permit submission.

**Time spent:** ~3 hours
