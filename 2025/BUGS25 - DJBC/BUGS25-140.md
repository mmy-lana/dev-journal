# 🗓️ Work Log — 19 March 2025

## ✅ Summary

  - Modified the `npwp15` parameter to use `nitku` instead of `npwp` in three JavaScript files related to customs document forms. [cite\_start]This change was implemented to address a bug where the incorrect value was being sent in the payload. [cite: 8, 9, 26]

## 🧠 Problem

[cite\_start]The `npwp15` parameter in the payload for the `get-data-barang` endpoint was incorrectly using `dataUser?.npwp` instead of `dataUser?.nitku`. [cite: 8, 9, 26] [cite\_start]This was confirmed with "mas nuim" that `npwp15` should be `nitku` for all documents hitting that endpoint. [cite: 9]

## 🔍 Investigation

  - [cite\_start]The issue was identified as a bug ([\#BUGS25-140]) by the IKC Team. [cite: 2, 5]
  - [cite\_start]The problematic endpoint was identified as `https://apisdev-gw.beacukai.go.id/v3/transaksional-tpb/tpb/barang/get-data-barang?kodeJenisBarang=1&kodeJenisBarang=5&kodeDokumen=203&npwp15=(nitku)&nomorPersetujuanPER-10-2024&tanggalPersetujuan$=12-09-2024$`. [cite: 9]
  - [cite\_start]The Jira ticket for this issue, BUGS25-140, is similar to TPB-146. [cite: 10]
  - [cite\_start]The front-end (FE) component was identified as the source of the problem. [cite: 5]

## 💡 Solution

[cite\_start]Updated the `npwp15` parameter to use `dataUser?.nitku` instead of `dataUser?.npwp` in the `params` useRef for the following files: [cite: 26]

```js
// Example from src/pages/dokumenPabean/form/dokumen/components/CreateDokumen.js
// Old:
// const params = useRef({ page: 0, size: 10, npwp15: dataUser?.npwp });
// New:
const params = useRef({ page: 0, size: 10, npwp15: dataUser?.nitku });
```

## 🧪 Result

  - ✅ Verified fix: The `npwp15` parameter now correctly sends `nitku` to the specified endpoint.
  - ✅ Tested edge cases: Source code vulnerability test passed.
