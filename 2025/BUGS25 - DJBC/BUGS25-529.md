# 🗓️ Work Log — 19 JUNE - 05 JULY 2025

## Pushed on Gitlab/Repositories 20/Jun/25 14:54

## ✅ Summary

  - Corrected the `/update-token` endpoint within the setting application from `amws` to `authws` and updated its version to `v3` to ensure proper token management.

## 🧠 Problem

The setting application was attempting to update tokens using an incorrect or outdated endpoint (`/amws/v1/user/update-token`), leading to failures in token refresh and potentially impacting user sessions or data synchronization.

## 🔍 Investigation

  - The issue was identified as a bug by the IKC Team and is tracked under Jira ticket **[\#BUGS25-529]**.
  - The problem was categorized as a Frontend (FE) issue affecting the "Modul Dokumen Pabean" (though the fix is in a general `setting-aplikasi` microfrontend).
  - The task was created on June 19, 2025, and its status was updated to "Done" on July 05, 2025.
  - The investigation revealed that the application was calling `https://apis-gw.customs.go.id/amws/v1/user/update-token` and `https://apisdev-gw.beacukai.go.id/v3/amws/v1/user/update-token` for production and development environments respectively. These endpoints needed to be aligned with the `authws` service and its `v3` version.

## 💡 Solution

The `/update-token` endpoint was updated to use the correct `authws` service and its v3 version across both production and development environments. This involved modifying the URL paths in the application's configuration where the token update call was made.

```js
// src/App.js (example of modification)
// ...
axios.post(
    newProd? "https://apis-gw.customs.go.id/v3/authws/user/update-token": "https://apisdev-gw.beacukai.go.id/v3/authws/user/update-token",
    // ...
);
// ...

// src/utils/DataUser.js (example of modification)
// ...
const { data } = await axios.post(
    newProd? 'https://apis-gw.customs.go.id/v3/authws/user/update-token': 'https://apisdev-gw.beacukai.go.id/v3/authws/user/update-token',
    // ...
);
// ...
```

## 🧪 Result

  - ✅ Verified fix: The application now successfully calls the correct `/update-token` endpoint (`authws/v3/user/update-token`).
  - ✅ Tested edge cases: Source code vulnerability tests passed, as indicated by "Status Uji SC: Tested Lulus".

## 🧠 Reflection

This fix ensures that the token update mechanism is robust and points to the correct authentication service, which is crucial for maintaining secure and continuous user sessions. It resolves a fundamental issue in the application's interaction with the authentication system. I worked on this for approximately 30-40 minutes.
