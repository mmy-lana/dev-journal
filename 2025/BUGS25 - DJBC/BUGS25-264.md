# 🗓️ Work Log — 23 APRIL - 23 MAY-2025

## ✅ Summary

  - Adjusted the endpoint address for fetching NITKU (Nomor Identitas Tempat Kegiatan Usaha) data within the "Entitas" tab of customs documents.

## 🧠 Problem

The endpoint address used to retrieve NITKU data in the "Entitas" tab of the customs document module required adjustment. The old endpoint `get-kswpv2-status` was incorrectly being called instead of the correct `get-nama-alamat-by-nitku`, preventing the proper fetching or display of NITKU information.

## 🔍 Investigation

  - The issue was identified as a bug by the IKC Team and tracked under Jira ticket [\#BUGS25-264].
  - The problem was categorized as a Frontend (FE) issue affecting the "Modul Dokumen Pabean".
  - The task was created on April 23, 2025, and its status was updated to "Done" on May 23, 2025.
  - The incorrect endpoint URL was identified during investigation: `https://apisdev-gw.beacukai.go.id/Referensi/v1/Npwp16/get-kswpv2-status?npwp=...` and needed to be changed to `https://apisdev-gw.beacukai.go.id/Referensi/v1/Npwp16/get-nama-alamat-by-nitku?npwp=...`.

## 💡 Solution

Adjusted the API endpoint in `HttpRequest.get` call within the `getEntitas` function to use `get-nama-alamat-by-nitku` instead of `get-kswpv2-status`, while retaining the `npwp` parameter.

```js
// src/pages/dokumenPabean/form/entitas/components/children/Nitku.js
// ...
  const getEntitas = (value) => {
    setLoading(true);
    HttpRequest.get({
-      url: `${process.env.REACT_APP_API_REFERENSI}/v1/Npwp16/get-kswpv2-status?npwp=${value}`,
+      url: `${process.env.REACT_APP_API_REFERENSI}/v1/Npwp16/get-nama-alamat-by-nitku?npwp=${value}`,
    })
      .then((res) => {
        if (res.data.kdStatus === "1") {
// ...
```

## 🧪 Result

  - ✅ Verified fix: The NITKU data is now correctly fetched and displayed within the "Entitas" tab of customs documents by calling the updated API endpoint.
  - ✅ Tested edge cases: Source code vulnerability tests passed, as indicated by "Status Uji SC: TestedAda TiketBaru".
