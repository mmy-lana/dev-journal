# 🗓️ Work Log — 15 & 25 April 2025

## ✅ Summary
Performed a round of high-severity bug and code smell cleanup on the CEISA Portal Pengguna Jasa frontend app. Issues addressed were identified through a security code review under task [BUGS25-205].

## 🧠 Problem
The codebase contained several unresolved high-priority issues flagged by SonarQube:

- 🐛 5 Bugs  
- 🧹 13 Code Smells  
- 🛡️ 1 Critical issue  
- ⚠️ 15 Major issues  

Most of the issues were related to:

- Redundant logic and unreachable code  
- Weak conditionals and poor logging practices  
- Misuse of assignments and improper branching

## 🔍 Investigation
SonarQube reports indicated problems in modules under the Portal PJ repository. The team determined these issues stemmed from legacy modules not cleaned up after previous deployments.

## 💡 Solution

Key actions:
- Cleaned up all CRITICAL, MAJOR, and BLOCKER severity code smells and bugs.
- Removed legacy branches and unreachable conditions.
- Standardized logging and removed unused assignments.
- Confirmed changes through GitLab CI and QA review.

Example commits:

```diff
- let unused = someFunc(); // never used
- if (condition) { return true; } else { return true; }

+ // Cleaned-up logic
+ return true;
```
