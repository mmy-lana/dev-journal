# 🗓️ Work Log — 08 - 15 JULY 2025

## Pushed on Gitlab/Repositories 11/Jul/25 08:29

## ✅ Summary

- Addressed and resolved **3 medium-level security hotspots** related to **weak cryptography** in the **Pemeriksaan Barang** module.
- Completed fixes for **1 critical** and **4 major** issues, with **0 blockers remaining**.
- Security Hotspots reduced from `222 [Medium: 3, Low: 219]` → `219 [Low only]`.

---

## 🧠 Problem

The source code of the `pemeriksaan-barang` frontend failed the **SonarQube security check** due to use of **insecure pseudorandom number generators**. This was marked as a **medium security hotspot** and could potentially expose cryptographic weaknesses if exploited.

---

## 🔍 Investigation

- Issue ID: [#BUGS25-642](https://jira.beacukai.go.id/browse/BUGS25-642)
- Identified through internal security testing conducted by the IKC team on `08/Jul/25`.
- Found within the `staging` branch of the repository.
- Security findings from SonarQube instance:  
  [SonarQube Link (Security Hotspots)](http://10.102.244.26:9000/security_hotspots?id=develop-BUGS25-642#)  
  [SonarQube Link (Vulnerabilities)](http://10.102.244.26:9000/project/issues?id=develop-BUGS25-642&resolved=false&severities=BLOCKER%2CCRITICAL%2CMAJOR)

---

## 💡 Solution

- Removed the usage of insecure pseudorandom generators (`Math.random` or equivalent).
- Replaced them with secure cryptographic alternatives such as `crypto.getRandomValues` or environment-specific secure libraries.
- Ensured no direct reliance on weak entropy for token generation or security checks.
- Cleaned up associated critical/major smells and vulnerabilities in the same branch.

---

## 🧪 Result

- ✅ 3 Medium-Level Security Hotspots removed.
- ✅ No Blocker, Critical, or Major issues remain in the SonarQube dashboard.
- ✅ Status updated to `TestedLulus` on 14/Jul/25.
- ✅ Merge Requests:
  - [MR #117 (Initial Fix)](https://gitlab.customs.go.id/ceisa-microfrontend/pemeriksaan-barang/merge_requests/117)
  - [MR #120 (Security Hotspot Final Fix)](https://gitlab.customs.go.id/ceisa-microfrontend/pemeriksaan-barang/merge_requests/120)

## 🧠 Reflection

This task emphasized the importance of **using secure cryptographic practices** in frontend code. Though frontend vulnerabilities may not always be critical, cryptography misuse could enable session or token-based attacks. By proactively resolving all flagged issues, the security profile of the application was significantly improved.
