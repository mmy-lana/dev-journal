# 🗓️ Work Log — 19-27 MAY-2025

## ✅ Summary

  - Resolved an issue preventing the retrieval of previously sent entity history by adjusting the logic for the `idPerusahaan` parameter in the entity drawer. The parameter is now consistently derived from `userData.nitku`.

## 🧠 Problem

The entity reference feature was unable to retrieve the history of entities that had been previously sent. This was due to an incorrect or inconsistent determination of the `idPerusahaan` parameter, which is essential for fetching the relevant history data. The parameter logic was sometimes based on a `localStorage` flag (`isNpwp15`) or `userData.identitas`, leading to incorrect queries.

## 🔍 Investigation

  - The issue was identified as a bug by the IKC Team and tracked under Jira ticket [#BUGS25-364].
  - The problem was categorized as a Frontend (FE) issue affecting the "Modul Dokumen Pabean".
  - The task was created on May 19, 2025, and its status was updated to "Done" on May 27, 2025.
  - Investigation revealed that the `idPerusahaan` parameter was being set conditionally, which was not robust enough to correctly fetch all entity history. Commit messages indicated a focus on ensuring `idPerusahaan` correctly utilized `userData.nitku`.

## 💡 Solution

The logic for defining the `idPerusahaan` parameter in `DrawerEntitas.js` was refined. Initially, it was set based on `userData.identitas` or context header. A subsequent change introduced a conditional check using `isNpwp15` from `localStorage` to select between `userData.npwp` and `userData.nitku`. The final and successful adjustment removed this conditional complexity, ensuring `idPerusahaan` is consistently set to `userData.nitku`, which proved to be the correct identifier for fetching entity history.

**Initial Change (Attempted conditional logic):**

```js
// src/pages/dokumenPabean/form/entitas/components/children/DrawerEntitas.js
// ...
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
+    const isNpwp15 = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('isNpwp15'));
    const [params, setParams] = useState({
-        idPerusahaan: userData.identitas ?? context.state?.header?.idPerusahaan,
+        idPerusahaan: isNpwp15 ? userData.npwp : userData.nitku,
        kodeEntitas: kodeEntitas,
        size: 10,
        page: 1,
// ...
```

**Final Change (Simplified to consistent `userData.nitku`):**

```js
// src/pages/dokumenPabean/form/entitas/components/children/DrawerEntitas.js
// ...
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
-    const isNpwp15 = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('isNpwp15'));
    const [params, setParams] = useState({
-        idPerusahaan: isNpwp15 ? userData.npwp : userData.nitku,
+        idPerusahaan: userData.nitku,
        kodeEntitas: kodeEntitas,
        size: 10,
        page: 1,
// ...
```

## 🧪 Result
