# 🗓️ Work Log — 08 - 10 JULY 2025

## Pushed on Gitlab/Repositories 08/Jul/25 17:30

## ✅ Summary

  - Fixed the datetime display format for "Tgl Perekaman LHP" on the "Hasil Pemeriksaan LHP" page by switching from 12-hour (`hh`) to 24-hour (`HH`) format.

## 🧠 Problem

The timestamp for LHP record entries was being displayed in a 12-hour format (`hh:mm:ss`), which lacked clarity and could lead to misinterpretation during operational reviews or audits.

## 🔍 Investigation

  - The issue was reported by the IKC Team under the Jira ticket **[#BUGS25-630]**.
  - The problem was categorized as a Frontend (FE) issue within the "Modul Dokumen Pabean" of the CEISA Pelayanan system.
  - The problem was raised on July 08, 2025, and resolved by July 10, 2025.
  - The affected component was part of the `pemeriksaan-barang` microfrontend in the CEISA system.
  - Initial inspection located the formatting logic inside `src/pages/lhp/LhpDokumen/HasilPerekaman/index.jsx` at line 172.

## 💡 Solution

Updated the timestamp format from 12-hour to 24-hour format by replacing `hh` with `HH` in the `moment()` formatting string.

```js
// Before
render: (text, record, e) => text ? moment(text).format('DD-MM-YYYY hh:mm:ss') : ''

// After
render: (text, record, e) => text ? moment(text).format('DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm:ss') : ''
```

## 🧪 Result

  - ✅ Verified fix: Timestamps are now shown in proper 24-hour format (`HH:mm:ss`).
  - ✅ Confirmed merge on Gitlab with commit: `028a3344e65e5bd3e4089c6d89be36cc0b5534bf`
  - ✅ Merge request approved: [MR #115](https://gitlab.customs.go.id/ceisa-microfrontend/pemeriksaan-barang/merge_requests/115)

## 🧠 Reflection

Although this was a small change, adjusting the time format from 12-hour to 24-hour display significantly improves readability and accuracy for audit logs and end-user comprehension. This is particularly important for regulatory systems like CEISA.
